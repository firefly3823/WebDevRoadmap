# HTML Basics

```html {"interactive":"false"}


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
</body>
</html>


```


### Key Points

1. **HTML Structure**
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type.
   - `<html>`: Root element that contains all other elements.
   - `<head>`: Contains metadata and settings for the document.
   - `<body>`: Contains the content displayed on the web page.

2. **Tags and Elements**
   - Tags act as containers for content or other tags.
   - Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, with content in between. Example: `<p>Paragraph</p>`.
   - Some HTML elements are self-closing or "empty" elements, such as `<br>`.

3. **Children and Parent Elements**
   - Elements nested inside other elements are called "children."
   - Example: `<head>` and `<body>` are children of `<html>`.

4. **Comments**
   - Comments are added using `<!-- comment -->` and are not visible on the rendered page.

## Rendering Process

1. **HTML Document**:
   - The HTML file contains the structure and content of the page.

2. **Browser**:
   - The browser reads the HTML document and interprets it.

3. **Rendered Page**:
   - The browser displays the visual representation of the HTML structure.

## Useful Tools

1. **Inspect Element**:
   - Right-click on a web page and choose "Inspect" to view and modify the page's HTML/CSS in real-time.

2. **View Page Source**:
   - Right-click on a web page and select "View Page Source" to see the underlying HTML code.
